Empty space of a little cool futuristic watch face.
There's almost nothing special in particular, or the name at least tells so, due to mediocre nature of embryo.
You certainly know I don't make any sense, but let me tell you, nonsense is one of the inspiration source of this a little cool watch face.

Few little cool things to notice:
- Rotating (animated) click wait triangle
Which unfortunately does nothing but animation. And worse, it doesn't look even futuristic enough. But it's a little cool right? I think so, though let me hear what you have to say in the comment.
- Battery cells glow
Just your run-of-the-mill battery indicator, but with a little cooler presentation, separating battery level between 10%.
- Battery cells glow
You notice there's actually 11 of them but your gear only charge to 100%? Sorry to tell you, but this watch face is only a little cool, so it won't increase your battery capacity to 110%. That one extra cell on the top is there to tell you you have full 100% power to take you to an only-a-little-cool future. Why? Because that super cell will disappear as soon as the battery drops by 1%. One is more than enough. You just can't take too many specials.
- Battery cells glow
On always-on display. It's a little cooler to have that glowing cell on your always-on display, so I put it there too. But unfortunately, it's just a little cooler because unlike the main screen, the cells on AOD only shows one cell each time at the level of current battery. One block drop each 10% battery depletion.
- Battery cells glow
You won't get sick of this. That extra one cell for full power indicator is also there on always-on display. A little cooler don't you agree? But, this time too, sorry to inform that you still can't have much time for super cool time because it will drop by one block the moment you full battery drops by 1%.
- Battery cells gl... No. Nothing more actually.
